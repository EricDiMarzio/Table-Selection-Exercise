# Interactive Data Table with Range Selection

A React implementation of a data table with drag-to-select functionality, inspired by spreadsheet applications like Excel or Google Sheets.

## Core Features

- **Multi-cell range selection** with visual feedback
- **Clipboard integration** for copying selected data
- **CSV export** of selected ranges
- **Column sorting** with visual indicators
- **Role-based filtering** with modal interface
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Escape to clear selection)
- **Click-outside detection** for UX polish

## Technical Implementation

### Range Selection Logic

The selection system uses a coordinate-based approach with alpha/omega cell tracking. This maintains selection state independent of data mutations (sorting/filtering) and enables efficient range calculations using coordinate bounds.

### Event Handling Strategy

Uses `onMouseDown` to initialize, `onMouseEnter` to extend selection during drag, and `onMouseUp` to finalize. Chose `onMouseEnter` over `onMouseMove` to reduce event frequency during drag operations. 

### Performance Considerations

- Event listeners are properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
- Selection is cleared on sort/filter operations to prevent stale coordinate references
- Coordinate-based highlighting runs O(1) calculations per cell

### CSV Export

Handles CSV escaping for strings containing commas/quotes using RFC 4180 compliant formatting. Creates programmatic downloads without server round-trip and includes proper cleanup of object URLs.

### Filtering Architecture

Uses a two-stage approach with local state in the modal, allowing users to preview filter changes before applying and enabling cancel functionality.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. **Select All Bug**: Currently selects from original dataset instead of filtered data
2. **No Column Virtualization**: Would be needed for tables with 50+ columns
3. **Mobile Support**: Touch events not implemented for mobile drag selection

### Potential Enhancements
- **Multi-selection**: Ctrl+click for non-contiguous ranges
- **Keyboard navigation**: Arrow keys for selection extension
- **Copy formatting**: Include cell styling in clipboard data
- **Undo/redo**: For destructive operations

## Dependencies

- React 18+ (uses modern hooks)
- CSS Modules (for styling)
- Modern browser (for Clipboard API and Blob downloads)

## Usage Notes

This implementation prioritizes code clarity and maintainability over performance optimization. For production use with large datasets (1000+ rows), consider:
- Virtual scrolling for row rendering
- Debounced selection updates
- Web Workers for CSV generation
- Intersection Observer for lazy loading

The coordinate-based selection system scales well to any table size since it operates on indices rather than DOM references.
